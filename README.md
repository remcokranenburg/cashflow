# cashflow

This is a program I created to analyze my personal finances. It has several
goals:

 - Gain insight into monthly income and expenses
 - Calculate net worth development
 - Predict financial future based on strategies

This used to be a complicated spreadsheet, but a program is more flexible and
less error-prone.
